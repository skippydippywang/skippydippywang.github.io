# EP1001 Further Digital Fabrication & Prototyping

**Learning Progress**

Welcome to the Further Digital Fabrication & Prototyping EP1001

**Week 1**

i learnt how to sand

**Week 2**

I was introduced to WOKWI which is an online electronic simulator. In WOKWI, I was able to porgram different microcontrollers with their repective programming languages to simulate circuits. For my first excersise I programmed an ESP32-C3 in C++ language. For the next 2 excersies, instead of using C++ to program, I used the micropython to progam the ESP32-C3 & the RP2040. For Excersie 4 I was tasked to use Generative AI chat to create a program for the ESP32-C3 to read input values from a potentiometer and use it to control the intensity of an LED.

Thr prompt that I use was "".
